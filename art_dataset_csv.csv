"Similarly to D2O, a continuous increase in solvation was observed with increase in glycerol or sorbitol content in the buffer, which leads to an increase in protein stability, as is verified by the increasing Tm and ΔH values obtained by microcalorimetric measurements (DSC).",Conclusion

"The redox processes within the electrically insulating microdroplets were shown to be very sensitive to the nature and concentration of ions in the surrounding aqueous phase as, in order to retain electroneutrality within the unsupported oil phase, electric field-induced migration of ions likely occurs during the Faradaic current flow.",Conclusion

"On the basis of the electrochemical data it is proposed that the unique capability of Mn-bicarbonate complexes to be photooxidized by PSII could be due to four possible reasons: (i) significantly larger decrease in the oxidation potential of MnII (down to 0.52 V); (ii) electroneutrality of the functional electron transfer complex; (iii) the more favorable energetics reflected in the two pKa values for H2CO3/HCO3− and HCO3−/CO32− and greater number of proton transfer sites; and (iv) multiple composition possibilities for the MnIII photo-product as MnIII(HCO3−)3, MnIII(HCO3−)(CO32−) and MnIII(HCO3−)2(OH−) (due to the high Lewis acidity of MnIII (pK < 1).",Conclusion

"Ternary complexes formed between calcium, the oxochromium(v) ion and N-acetylneuraminic (sialic) acid (naH6) of the form, Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6, have electronic structures and equilibrium distributions distinct from the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 analogues, as illustrated by electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy.",Conclusion
"This work shows that in the presence of excess Ca(ii) ([Ca(ii)] : [naH6] = 10) there is significant modulation to the Cr(v) EPR signals (Fig. 1; purple) which suggests the formation of ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 complexes that have electronic structures (as indicated by variations in giso values and 1H aiso values) distinct from the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 analogues. Also, the pH-dependent equilibrium distribution of oxoCr(v)–naH6 species clearly differs in the presence of Ca(ii); the appearance of complex multiplets at lower pH values in the ternary system, relative to the binary system (Fig. 1b), is likely due to the Ca(ii)-induced lowering of the hydroxyl pKa values of naH6, thereby increasing the relative concentration of ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6(diolato) species.",Conclusion
"These differences suggest that the interaction between Ca(ii) and naH6, as modelled from NMR spectroscopic data (O1, OR, O7, O8), restricts the conformational flexibility of the glycerol tail, effectively acting as an ‘ionic lock’.",Conclusion
"The magnetic inequivalence of the protons in the second coordination sphere of ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 complexes (Fig. 2; Table 1) is also explained by the ‘ionic lock’ mechanism, since the {Ca(ii)–naH5}+ structure places H8, H9 and H9′ in unique magnetic environments.",Conclusion
"This suggests that in the case of oxoCr(v)–diolato complexes, the presence of Ca(ii) modifies the polarizability of the donor oxygen atom (increases the ‘hardness’), which correlates with an increase in the giso value.",Conclusion
"No change in giso value is observed for well characterised tert-2-hydroxycarboxylate oxoCr(v) complexes ([CrO(hmba(2−))2]− (hmba(2−) = 2-hydroxy-2-methylbutanoato), giso = 1.9784) in the presence of Ca(ii), which indicates a poor affinity of Ca(ii) towards an isolated hydroxycarboxylate group and suggests that the polyfunctionality of naH6 is an important determinant of Ca(ii) binding.",Conclusion
The limit of the determination was improved by adopting the enzyme label.,Conclusion
"Moreover, detection procedures were greatly simplified and required time for the detection was significantly cut.",Conclusion
Detecting the reaction product in a solution was much easier to do than making surface measurements and determination limit was improved by adoption of the enzyme label due to amplification of the signals derived by the enzyme reaction.,Conclusion

These peaks are consistent with the formation of a pyrochlore phase.,Conclusion
"Clearly, the preceding treatments have already conferred upon the sample the potential to undergo low temperature reduction, which in turn leads to very low temperature pyrochlore formation.",Conclusion
"Neither effect is observed with 1% H2, SR and SO 1173 K, thereby implying a link between promoted reduction and low temperature pyrochlore formation.",Conclusion
"Despite this, pyrochloric structure was observed only in Fig. 2B, corresponding to TPR profile B1′, thereby indicating that extent of reduction is not directly responsible for pyrochlore formation.",Conclusion
"We find no clear correlation between the appearance of the Raman spectra and reduction profile (or formation of pyrochlore), although it must be reiterated that the possible presence of impurity peaks makes identification of any such correlation difficult.",Conclusion
"Instead, we believe that a more complex situation than a simple structure–TPR relationship may be inferred for the TPR behaviour of this sample.",Conclusion
"Therefore, as suggested by an anonymous referee, it cannot be excluded that the pyrochlore nucleation process occurs in high temperature conditions (its rate being increased by increasing hydrogen pressure), while the growth process could occur with a significant rate at moderate temperatures.",Conclusion
"Once formed superficially at high temperature, a very thin pyrochlore layer (the nuclei) could be transformed into the κ phase under mild conditions, which in turn gives the pyrochlore structure (as in Fig. 2b) at low temperature, first on the surface then inwards of the particle (growth process).",Conclusion
"On the other hand while the Raman technique proved to be sensitive in detecting the κ phase, no evidence for its presence was observed here.",Conclusion
"In summary, formation of a bulk pyrochloric structure, i.e. an ordered system, is not a necessary prerequisite to achieve promoted redox properties in Ce0.5Zr0.5O2.",Conclusion

"Quantum size effects, as observed for the luminescence of nanocrystalline semiconductors, are not expected for the luminescence of Ce3+ in NC YAG.",Hypothesis
"It is expected that, through local field effects, the lower effective refractive index would reduce the radiative decay rate of the Ce3+ emission in NC YAG:Ce in comparison with the bulk.",Hypothesis
"Further, non-radiative processes are more important for the nanocrystal than for the bulk materials due to the larger surface to volume ratio, which is reflected in an initial deviation from single-exponential decay and a lower quantum efficiency.",Hypothesis
"Radiative transfer from the Ce3+ ions to the TRITC molecules may also occur, but would not lead to shorter life times for the donor states.",Hypothesis
"Since both the Ce3+ and the TRITC emissions are allowed electric-dipole transitions, the dipole–dipole interaction will be strong allowing efficient ET to occur if the Ce3+–TRITC distances are sufficiently small.",Hypothesis
"As a result, energy transfer rates of 108 s−1 and faster are expected for Ce3+ ions in an outer shell of 5 nm thick in the NC.",Hypothesis
"TRITC will degrade after being exposed to UV light for a long period, while YAG:Ce is photostable.",Hypothesis

It also highlights the possibility that sulfate reduction may occur in-situ under reducing reaction conditions.,Hypothesis
From correlations between changes of phyA′ versus phyA″ content and the phenotype of phyA mutants and transgenic plants it can be inferred that the light-labile phyA′ pool is probably responsible for de-etiolation whereas the relatively light-stable phyA″ pool might function throughout the entire life cycle of the plant.,Hypothesis
"In addition, phyA″ might also modify (suppress) the action of phyA′.",Hypothesis
"Hormones might affect the state and functions of the pigment, a possibility that so far has been mostly neglected.",Hypothesis
"This finding suggests that the reaction of a clean single Al-terminated surface with water should be a complex multistage process, ultimately resulting in a surface transformation into a gibbsite-like structure, which can be formally viewed as substitution of the each surface Al by three H atoms.",Hypothesis
"According to the discussion of the OH stretching vibrations it can be assumed that the water molecule undergoes a hydrogen acceptor bond, i.e. water is attached to one of the three NH groups and forms a N–H⋯O hydrogen bond.",Hypothesis
This π-interaction may lead to an additional stabilization of this structure.,Hypothesis

It is reasonable to ask the question as to whether or not the inclusion of the physicochemical parameters clogP and cMR would improve the EVA model.,Hypothesis
The implication may be that the information contained within the physicochemical parameters is already encoded intrinsically within the EVA descriptor.,Hypothesis
A possible explanation is that individual particles bridging the oil film are acting as spacers and prevent the two oil–water interfaces from coalescing.,Hypothesis
"In addition, it is likely that if the colloidosome is expanded gradually, more particles will adsorb to the inner oil–water interface from the drop interior.",Hypothesis
More research is needed to reveal whether the particles are uniformly distributed in the diluted bridging monolayer due to mutual repulsion or clustered in 2D aggregates.,Hypothesis
The instability could possibly be due to fact that the latex particles in the colloidosome membrane are not fused and cannot effectively prevent its coalescence with the top decane phase.,Hypothesis
It is therefore to be expected that Al–O distances in zeolites are longer than those found when silicon occupies a similar site.,Hypothesis
"This can be done by recognising that silicon–oxygen interatomic distances are almost invariant in different materials, as is to be expected for a strong covalent bond.",Hypothesis
"Increasing the Al–O bond length will result in variation of the charge distribution between the oxygen, proton and aluminium atoms which in turn is expected to influence the acidity of the protonic zeolite.",Hypothesis

"From the positioning of the aromatic ring of F186, predicted from computer assisted structural modeling, it was proposed that this residue might facilitate electron transfer between Tyr-Z and P680.",Hypothesis
This led to the idea that the stabilization is due to an optimal ratio of the cation size and the size of the cavity formed by the four guanines in the tetrad.,Hypothesis
This is remarkable because one could expect that the steric constraints would prevent the guanine tetrads cavities to narrow to the same level as the formamide ones.,Hypothesis
One way to interpret this is to consider that the metal–oxygen electrostatic attraction would be the most important driving force on the tetrad structure modification upon metallation.,Hypothesis
"The underlying mechanism, we believe, involves the reactions with organic molecules effectively relaxing the internal energy of the laser ablation plasma, which was advantageous for the formation of larger size cluster species in the starting part of the reaction channel.",Hypothesis
"Obviously, the most possible bonding pattern in these anion products is that the phenyl groups bond on the metal surfaces using the metal–carbon σ bond.",Hypothesis
Such arrays might allow architectures to be fabricated which might facilitate ‘bottom-up’ alternatives to conventional (lithography) integrated circuit (IC) processing.,Hypothesis
The observation of reflections at greater repeat distances than the (100) reflection may be attributable to the slight strain (as noted above) of the hexagonal lattice observed which results in a larger unit cell.,Hypothesis
That weak (110) and the other partial order reflections are observed might suggest that there is either a small misalignment of the film or that small parts of the film are randomly orientated.,Hypothesis
"Instead, we argue that the azimuthal dependence is related to preferential diffraction of the X-rays when they are perpendicular to the X-ray beam direction.",Hypothesis
Laue diffraction (diffraction condition is d(cosΩ – cosΘ) = nλ) can occur from planes within the bulk.,Hypothesis
Instead we believe that these are small changes in peak position observed because of X-ray refraction through the film.,Hypothesis
Instead it is more likely that the film has a structure similar to the centred rectangular arrangements observed by Grosso et al.,Hypothesis
The change in absorption in diseased regions that gives rise to contrast in TPI images might be attributed to a change in the intermolecular vibrational modes of water molecules with other functional groups.,Hypothesis
"However, it is not obvious that the same would be true for polymorphs.",Hypothesis
"Again, the 2.75 THz feature could be a hydrogen bond with a harmonic potential or an intramolecular vibration which is not affected by temperature change.",Hypothesis
"Because of its symmetric minimum energy structure, it is expected that the torsional distribution of conformer I has a single peak at ϕ1 = 180°.",Hypothesis
"The degeneracy number of conformer III will reduce to one as the distribution peaks merge at higher temperatures, so the corresponding decrease in the relative conformer entropies is to be expected.",Hypothesis
"However, it is likely that the experiments employing the lighter neon gas provides a more appropriate basis for comparison with the gas-phase calculations.",Hypothesis
"Although the presence of conformer III in the matrix-IR experiments suggests that matrix deposition cooling is more gentle than free jet expansion, the possibility of interconversion cannot be discounted.",Hypothesis
"TPIMC calculations with nb = 1 are equivalent to a classical mechanical description, and the calculations nb = 15 are expected to recover almost all quantum effects for glycine in this temperature range.",Hypothesis

"Although C1 may be formed upon thermal vaporization, the poor agreement between theory and experiment in our studies, as well as the previous experimental studies of cytosine, suggests that it is not the only tautomer accessed.",Hypothesis
It is possible that tautomerization could also occur during complex formation or collision-induced dissociation of the metal ion–cytosine complexes.,Hypothesis
"The dipole moment of C4 is calculated to be 5.46 D. This suggests that if the relative stabilities of the cytosine tautomers could be predicted based solely upon their dipole moments as the above correlation for the C1, C2, and C3 tautomers suggests, then C4 would be expected to be more stable than C1, but less stable than C2 and C3.",Hypothesis
"Because of the difficulty of evaporating cytosine solid, the concentration of C1 in the gas phase is likely to be very low, and the possibility of two cytosine molecules associating into a dimer might not be very significant.",Hypothesis
"However, in the region very close to the heated cytosine sample, it is reasonable to believe that the density of cytosine molecules is large enough that such association of cytosine might be feasible under the experimental vaporization conditions.",Hypothesis
Tautomerization via double proton transfer might occur in the solid phase resulting in a mixture of cytosine tautomers being present in the heated solid.,Hypothesis
"Thus, it seems plausible that such a solid-state tautomerization mechanism might dominate the tautomerization processes that occur upon thermal heating of cytosine.",Hypothesis
Simulated annealing or direct dynamics simulations might also provide additional insight into this much more complicated process.,Hypothesis

"It is likely that packets sent (early) along A-B-C may arrive at the receiver later than packets sent (late) along A-C, resulting in out-of-order arrivals.",Hypothesis
"Then, if an attacker sends a spoofing packet to the host; it is likely the hop-count of the packet will not match the expected hop-count for packets from the spoofed source address.",Hypothesis
" Because legitimate hop-counts may change due to routing changes, strictly filtering all packets that do not match would lead to false positives.",Hypothesis
" In order to minimize false positives, HCF only begins filtering traffic if some threshold amount of packets does not match their expected hop counts.",Hypothesis

This procedure uses electrostatic interactions to entrap positively charged cadmium ions into thin films of the anionic surfactant AOT by a simple immersion of the film in electrolyte solution.,Method
"Thereafter, the composite film is treated with H2S gas/Na2S solution resulting in the in-situ formation of CdS nanoparticles in the quantum size regime.",Method
"Investigation of the entrapment of cadmium ions in the AOT film and subsequent quantum dot synthesis was carried out by quartz crystal microgravimetry (QCM), UV-Vis spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) measurements.",Method

"Subsequently, the films, after lifting onto a suitable substrate, are treated with Na2S solution for synthesis of CdS nanoparticles.",Method
"In this laboratory, some of us have successfully used electrostatic interactions to entrap cadmium ions into thermally evaporated fatty acid films and then form CdS nanoparticles by chemical treatment of the immobilized cadmium ions.",Method
"In the present work, we describe attempts to synthesize cadmium sulfide nanoparticles within thermally evaporated thin films of sodium bis(2-ethylhexyl)sulfosuccinate (AOT).",Method
The choice of AOT was motivated by the possibility of better size control over formation of CdS nanoparticles.,Method
"Though the conditions of our experiment are not identical to that experienced by AOT in reverse micelles, we believe that the propensity of this surfactant to form spherical structures in an aqueous environment would provide a confining influence on CdS nanoparticles formed in the AOT matrix and thus, better control over nanoparticle size than that afforded by stearic acid thin films.",Method
Another motivating factor for the use of AOT is the interesting optical properties of AOT capped CdS nanoparticles.,Method
Synthesizing nanoparticles such as CdS in lipid thin films by electrostatic entrapment of suitable ions can potentially provide many additional advantages over other methods of forming nanoparticulate thin films.,Method
Using this method it is possible to achieve patterned nanoparticulate thin films by suitable masking of the lipid film.,Method
"Apart from allowing the possibility of pattern formation, our method enables the convenient formation of nanoparticulate thin films even on nonplanar and topologically highly complex surfaces, which is difficult if not impossible to achieve by other thin film forming techniques.",Method
"By sequential entrapment of different metal ions, formation of nanocomposite thin films constituted by different semiconducting nanoparticles or formation of doped semiconducting nanoparticulate thin film should also be achievable.",Method
"It involves the irradiation of a sample with a laser and the measurement of components of light scattered from the target system, which are displaced in frequency by one vibrational unit.",Method
"The pattern of signals is often diagnostic or is characteristic of a particular molecule or group, enabling in situ detection, particularly if the analyte signal is enhanced over the background.",Method
Water provides very poor Raman scattering and consequently is nearly transparent making the technique useful in bioanalysis.,Method
"However, there are two big disadvantages, namely that Raman scattering is weak with only 1 in about 108 scattered photons being Raman scattered and fluorescence from the sample matrix can often swamp the Raman signal.",Method
Among the most effective is SERRS in which the analyte molecule is adsorbed onto a suitable roughened surface such as that of silver or gold nanoparticles and an excitation frequency close to the plasmon frequency of the particles is used.,Method
The enhancement can be increased further by using an analyte which is a dye for which one of the absorption peaks lies in a frequency region reasonably close to the excitation frequency(within 50–100 nm).,Method
SERRS enhancement of the Raman signal of up to 10^14 has been claimed and single molecule detection has been demonstrated.,Method
"In addition to the sensitivity, one of the major improvements of SERRS over existing technologies is that the Raman signals obtained are sharp and can be interpreted easily in terms of the resonance spectrum of the analyte.",Method
The narrow signals can be more easily resolved than those of fluorescence and the signal pattern is molecularly specific.,Method
"Thus, individual dyes can be clearly discriminated in mixtures and this opens up the potential for the coding of nanoparticles with multiple labels in a manner which enables them to be identified in situ in a flowing stream or in a biological matrix.",Method
"This model addresses the question of charge trapping and hopping, and it permits the computation of the potential energy surface relevant to charge transfer using a single Hamiltonian.",Method

This EI ion source generates A+–Ln complexes via EI of A followed by cluster aggregation.,Method
"Consequently, the EI source produces predominantly the most stable isomer of a given A+–Ln complex, independent of the most stable structure of neutral A–Ln.",Method
Microfiltration and dielectrophoresis have been used to integrate blood sample preparation with PCR on microfabricated devices.,Method

"As an alternative, paramagnetic beads offer a means to form an immunocapture bed to isolate rare cells from blood.",Method
Protein A/anti-human CD3 paramagnetic beads were first introduced into the chips and captured in a field generated by an external magnet.,Method

"Nanomechanical cantilevers have a high sensitivity and a minimal detectable mass density, in comparison with electromechanical devices, such as the quartz crystal microbalance (QCM), the flexural plates wave (FPW) device, and the surface acoustic wave (SAW) device.",Method
"In general, the cantilevers can detect specific compounds in both dynamic and static modes.",Method
"Most of the current nanomechanical cantilever based sensors are focused on the deflection, i.e. the static mode, arising from a change in surface properties due to antigen–antibody binding using the optical detection method.",Method
"However, the optical stress measuring system has some limitations, such as a narrow dynamic range and a parasitic deflection.",Method
These limitations in detection using the static mode are a serious problem for the development of feasible cantilever sensors with high sensitivity and reproducibility.,Method

Several studies have used electron microscopy to demonstrate the presence of the glycocalyx in the microcirculation.,Method
"Conventional electron microscopy requires that cell specimens be dehydrated during the fixation procedure so that the total volume of extracellular material is significantly reduced or collapsed and compressed, leading to the distortion of the glycocalyx architecture.",Method
"To eliminate this problem, we have chosen to develop methodology centred on confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) to study the hydrated glycocalyx of viable, cultured endothelial cells derived from human umbilical vein.",Method
"We used a fluorescein isothiocyanate-linked wheat germ agglutinin (WGA-FITC), which binds selectively to N-acetyl-d-glucosaminyl residues, a constituent of heparan sulfate, the major saccharide of cell surface proteoglycans and to N-acetylneuraminic (sialyl) residues, making a significant contribution to the surface charge and representing a major component of the endothelial glycocalyx.",Method

"Frequently, A+–Ln complexes are generated by the formation of neutral A–Ln complexes in a supersonic molecular beam expansion, followed by resonance enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI).",Method
"For the spectroscopic characterization of A+–Ln, the REMPI process is usually combined with photoionization efficiency measurements (PIE), mass analysed threshold ionization (MATI), zero kinetic energy photoelectron (ZEKE) spectroscopy, or photodissociation (PD) spectroscopy.",Method
"However, all these ionization techniques suffer from the severe restrictions imposed by the Franck–Condon principle, which prevents the efficient population of the most stable isomer of A+–Ln in cases where the global minimum structures of the neutral and the cation complex are rather different.",Method
"To overcome the limitations of the REMPI technique for cluster ion generation (“REMPI ion source”), the present work employs electron impact (EI) ionization within a supersonic expansion for the production of cold A+–Ln complexes.",Method
"Hence, the EI source forms predominantly the most stable A+–Ln isomer, independent of the most stable geometry of the corresponding neutral A–Ln species.",Method
"This is in contrast to the REMPI source, which often generates only local minima of A+–Ln.",Method

(2) consists of the product of the i → f transition dipole squared and the normalized lineshape function.",Method
"On the other hand, since we know the TPA cross sections we can calculate the ratio: The product |Mif|2g(2νp) is proportional to the excited state absorption εif(2νp – νi0).",Method
"In effect, (4) gives us the ratio of the excited-state extinction coefficients of dimer and monomer ε(D)if(2νp – νi0)/ε(M)if(2νp – νi0).",Method

The collision complexes are excited with polarized laser light and a detection laser is used to separate the excited Na atoms from the background.,Method
From flight time measurement the velocity of the Na atoms after collision is obtained; this allows to reconstruct the kinematics of the observed scattering processes.,Method
The results are presented as polar diagrams of the probability as a function of an orientation angle; they are analysed with the aid of numerical simulations using quantum chemically calculated potential surfaces and classical trajectories.,Method
"A related experiment consists in measuring the ratio of excited Na atoms leaving the complex in the lower 3p1/2 fine structure state compared to the sum 3p1/2 + 3p3/2, the two levels being separated by spin–orbit interaction.",Method
"These variations are used to provide a theoretical description of the bacterial adhesion to glass by interaction free energy, which is verified with experimental results employing a parallel plate flow chamber set at 37 °C, to simulate the conditions of flow inside the human body.",Method
"In this sense, theoretical predictions of the adhesion process based on interaction free energy calculations have been compared with experimental adhesion results in different investigations.",Method
The positive correlation between both magnitudes could help to predict and consequently control biofilm formation.,Method
Both components are calculated from the contact angles that probe liquids form on lawns of bacteria deposited on filters.,Method
The electrical interaction free energy is obtained from the zeta potential (ζ) of bacteria and substrata.,Method
Static and dynamic adhesion-based tests are the most commonly used.,Method
"However, static tests have been criticised because they neglect the conditions of flow that bacteria find in different parts of the human body and because they usually need a biochemical method to permit the count of the adhered bacteria.",Method
"This work therefore utilises a flow chamber to carry out the adhesion of E. faecalis to glass, allowing a live observation of microorganisms adhered to solid substrata.",Method
"For some time now, computational chemistry has been an important tool for probing, observing, explaining and verifying what had been discovered experimentally.",Method
"Calculations may verify or refute results still in question, or explain chemical, physical and other phenomena, whilst discovering previously unknown trends.",Method
"Combining experiment and theory results in a powerful and efficient instrument, enabling study of any kind of chemistry.",Method
"For instance, one may use an extended basis set, utilizing three or more lobes to describe an orbital; or employ polarization functions, describing the change imposed on an orbital during the transition from free to bonded state.",Method
Diffuse functions constitute a further effort to improve theory.,Method
"Development of diffuse functions allowed orbital flexibility during calculation, allowing a more accurate description of the true, diminished electron repulsion, mainly for anions, and lowering the estimate of total energy, in accordance with the variation principle.",Method
This process is considered for the ensemble of independent rings and for the array of the interacting rings by means of Monte Carlo simulations.,Method
"However, some authors, by using nonlinear absorption data or hole burning experiments for the same LH2 complexes of Rb. sphaeroides, have come to a conclusion that the exciton coherence radius is large, almost covering the whole ring of the pigments.",Method
The inhomogeneous distribution among the LH2 complexes as well as within a separate complex is well demonstrated by spectroscopic experiments on single LH2 complexes supporting the conclusion that the absorption spectra of B850 at low temperatures is consistent with the coherent exciton model of a ring-like arrangement of pigments with a disordered distribution of the molecular transition energies.,Method
"Utilizing an isotopically labeled reactant (18O2) and state-selective product detection, we determine the relative flux through different paths on the potential energy surface leading to a single asymptote: H + CO + CO2.",Method
"The measurement of total rate coefficients, product branching ratios, and product energy distributions are common methods in the elucidation of reaction mechanisms.",Method
"Typically, each product branching ratio is interpreted as a measurement of the flux through one exit channel of the reaction.",Method
"In such cases it is usually quite difficult, if not impossible, to experimentally determine the contributions of these multiple reaction paths because they produce identical products.",Method
"It is sometimes possible to measure contributions from multiple pathways if energy partitioning in a product molecule depends strongly on the different pathways, but this method may only be viable for the simplest cases.",Method
Isotopic labeling of reactants combined with isotope-specific detection of products offers the possibility of probing contributions of individual reaction paths in addition to more commonly measured product branching ratios.,Method
Isotopic labeling has been widely applied in various fields of chemistry to determine the properties of chemical compounds and their origins and evolutions in reactions.,Method
"This technique can provide important insights into reaction mechanisms and dynamics, where the same products may arise from several different pathways, although such studies are still scarce.",Method
All the possible isotopic variants of CO and CO2 can be easily separated by rotationally-resolved infrared spectroscopy.,Method
The emission spectra of the isotopically labeled products provide a direct measurement of the reactive flux through different reaction pathways.,Method
"Of course, matching of even a considerable number of bands can be quite accidental, and other relations like pairs of broad and narrow bands, assignment of almost all DIBs within a range of 500 Å, and trends in the intensity distributions are used as evidence for this theoretical description.",Method
Laser induced fragmentation studies of RM clusters of K give information on both excitation states and sizes of the clusters.,Method
Such studies gave the first direct microscopic proof of the properties of RM.,Method
Note that the main method in these studies is NOT mass spectrometry but neutral time-of-flight since no electric field accelerates any ions for the time-of-flight measurements.,Method
The process giving the neutral particles (clusters) their high quantized kinetic energy is Coulomb explosions induced by the laser pulse passing through the RM cloud.,Method
"In a new type of study, namely laser Raman spectroscopic studies, unique information about the electronic processes in RM can be obtained.",Method
"Recently, the first emission spectroscopic study has been performed with RM in the infrared range.",Method
"Stimulated emission in RM was subsequently used in an ultra wide-band tunable IR laser, which may be the first thermally excited laser.",Method
"The impedance spectroscopy technique is widely used in electrochemistry and solid-state electrochemistry, particularly for investigation of new and interesting systems such as nanostructured semiconductor electrodes and photoelectrochemical solar cells.",Method
"Different assumptions have been used in recent years in order to obtain more realistic model spectra: anomalous diffusion processes, multiple trapping and non-uniform conductivity and capacitance.",Method
"The different shapes are obtained by changing only one parameter, the charge-transfer resistance Rrec.",Method
"In this method a short coherent light pulse, the pump, excites the S0 → S1 transition of a solute.",Method
"Coherent motion in the sample may be either directly excited on the S1 surface, or excited by impulsive stimulated resonance Raman scattering in S0.",Method
"The resultant coherent vibrational motion in the sample modulates its optical properties, which are probed by a time delayed probe pulse.",Method
"To optimise the signal-to-noise ratio we used a diffractive optics based TG technique, which amplifies the TG signal while reducing jitter.",Method
"Our experiment is based on the designs of Miller, Fleming and their co-workers (Fig. 1).",Method
The decay of the grating is monitored by the intensity of the signal scattered from the time delayed probe pulse 1 in the direction 2.,Method
Before each TG measurement the pulsewidth from the NOPA at the sample position was carefully optimised by adjusting a dispersive prism pair.,Method
It should be noted that without such optimisation the coherent vibrational dynamics described below could not be reliably observed.,Method
Since we are mainly interested in the coherent vibrational dynamics we subtracted these exponential components from the experimental data to isolate the residual oscillatory response (Fig. 2b).,Method
"In conclusion, we have used a sensitive diffractive optics based TG method to investigate the low frequency modes of a GFP mutant.",Method
In the field of combustion research modeling provides a strong tool for the analysis of chemical and physical phenomena and predictions of properties of combustion systems.,Method
"To obtain an optimal C3 data set, simultaneous optimisation of the kinetics of small and intermediate sized fuels was necessary.",Method
The reaction pathways leading to benzene are analysed by application of sensitivity and reaction flow analysis.,Method
"The results are compared with those of other experimental and computational studies with respect to the fuel, the temperature range and the vital role of the propargyl radical as a key intermediate in benzene formation.",Method
"Cationic and anionic clusters 195Ptn±, 1 ≤ n ≤ 24, were generated by laser vaporization using an isotopically enriched platinum sample.",Method
Mass spectra were acquired after a series of varying reaction delays.,Method
"A crude selection of a cluster size range was accomplished by adjusting the timing of the cell trapping, effectively selecting a fraction of ions within a certain time of flight window from the source to the ICR cell.",Method
"Relative rate constants were obtained by fitting the experimental data to pseudo-first order reaction kinetics, and converted to absolute rate constants and reaction efficiencies using the average dipole orientation (ADO) theory.",Method
The advantage of using isotopically enriched platinum is exemplified by the n = 7 cluster in Fig. 1.,Method
"More detailed insight and quantitative reaction rates are obtained by actually fitting the time-intensity profile to pseudo-first-order kinetics, as exemplified in Fig. 3. 195Pt8+ is shown in the top panel.",Method

"Illumination with 660-nm light shifts the in vitro equilibrium between the two towards approximately 85% Pfr and triggers a physiological response in vivo, whereas illumination with 730-nm light yields about 99% Pr and cancels the physiological effect.The kinetics of the Pr → Pfr phototransformation has been extensively studied by a variety of time-resolved spectroscopic techniques, and a number of metastable intermediates states with lifetimes in the micro to millisecond regime and distinctive absorption characteristics (λmax) have thereby been identified.",Method
"In later studies resonance Raman (RR) techniques, which offer a means to investigate the in situ structure of chromophores in proteins, have been used to probe the conformation of PΦB at different stages of the photocycle.",Method
"By calculating ground and excited-state potential energy surfaces (PES) taking into account both concerted (Z,syn → E,anti) and stepwise (Z → E followed by syn → anti) reaction pathways, we will in particular herein be able to present valuable new information with regard to the nature and starting of the syn → anti isomerization (photochemical isomerization simultaneously with Z → E or thermal isomerization after Z → E).",Method
"It should here be pointed out that the above studies were carried out using multiconfigurational complete active space self-consistent field (CASSCF) methods, which constitute the most appropriate theoretical framework for the modeling of photochemical reactions.",Method
"However, such methods are inevitably marred by substantial computational demands, rendering them inapplicable to a molecular system as large as PΦB.",Method
"The density functional theory (DFT)-based approach undertaken in this work, on the other hand, enables the necessary calculations, but provides a less accurate description in regions where two potential energy surfaces come close in energy.",Method
"The earlier near-IR investigation of hydrated tryptophan included a series of calculated structures and the corresponding O–H and N–H vibrational spectra of its lowest lying singly, doubly and triply hydrated clusters, computed using density functional theory (DFT), as well as their relative energies, computed ab initio and including electron correlation.",Method
"Additionally, the successful application of a free-electron laser source (FELIX), generating pulsed infrared radiation from the mid-IR down to the far IR region, to IR ion-dip studies of nucleic acid bases and lactose as well as to tryptophan itself has encouraged a reinvestigation of the hydrated clusters of tryptophan.",Method
"In order to circumvent the small dimensions of cells leading to weak statistics when investigating the diffusion properties of single membrane components, a technique based on optical microscopy employing Langmuir monolayers as membrane model systems has been developed in our lab.",Method
"These measurements with long observation times, thus far only possible with this method, were combined with respective Monte-Carlo simulations.",Method
"Since the packing density of lipids within monolayers at the air/water interface can be changed easily, inhomogeneity with regard to the phase state can be achieved by isothermal compression to coexistence regions.",Method
Monte Carlo methods can give results regarding diffusion on length scales which correspond to those of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and SPT data (in the range of 10−9–10−6 m).,Method
"In the following section, recent achievements in developing the method of SPT on Langmuir monolayers are briefly summarized.",Method
The methods used for experiments and simulations of the model are described in Section 3.,Method
"The Fukui function fk+ and local softness sk+ are assigned as reactivity parameters for nucleophilic addition reaction in acrolein, methylacrylate, methylmethacrylate, acryloylchloride, cinnamaldehyde and cinnamoylchloride.",Method
We apply image correlation spectroscopy techniques to determine quantitatively the density of the receptors and the caveolin-1 isotypes as well as the extent to which they co-localize.,Method

"In order to understand the reason for the swelling of cells, microanalysis by energy-dispersive X-ray (EDAX) spectroscopy of the same region was carried out. After treatment of the electrocyte with 1, the relative semi-quantitative contents [Kα (wt%)] of oxygen, sodium, and chloride ions were 39, 17, and 15, respectively.",Method
In the present work we report some results obtained by Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) that provide us with a better understanding of the thermal behaviour of salol.,Method

Several methods based on this technique have been developed using a groove binder or intercalator as the hybridization indicator.,Method

Traditional analysis of total esterified fatty acids in such lipids by gas chromatography provides little information about such specificities of phospholipid structure and function.,Method
"In contrast, the application of electrospray ionisation mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) has had a dramatic impact on studies characterising membrane lipid compositions, due to its exquisite sensitivity and the detailed nature of the information provided.",Method
"In this paper, we describe the further application of ESI-MS/MS to quantify absolute rates of phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis in intact human white blood cells.",Method
"In PPC, the apparent coefficient of thermal expansion of the protein is deduced from the heat consumed or produced after small isothermal pressure jumps, which strongly depends on the interaction of the protein with the solvent at the protein–solvent interface.",Method
"Applying this method, determination of the thermal expansion coefficient and relative volume changes, ΔV/V, upon unfolding of proteins in solution has advantages over densimetric measurements since its sensitivity is higher by more than one order of magnitude.",Method
The observed volume and expansivity changes are correlated with further thermodynamic properties obtained from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC).,Method
"We have chosen to study the solvation properties and stability of a well characterized monomeric protein, staphylococcal nuclease (Snase), in H2O and D2O buffer solutions, as well as in the presence of various types of co-solvents, such as glycerol, sorbitol, urea and potassium sulfate.",Method
"Their influence on the expansivity as well as the denaturation temperature, relative volume and enthalpy changes upon unfolding were obtained with high accuracy.",Method
"The furan⋯HCl complex was detected and characterised by means of its rotational spectrum, as observed by pulsed-nozzle, Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy.",Method
In this technique the complexes are produced by supersonic expansion and therefore only the lowest energy conformer in its zero-point state is usually detected.,Method
"We report here an investigation of thiophene⋯HBr by means of its ground-state rotational spectrum observed by the pulsed-jet, Fourier transform (FT) method.",Method
"The theory is numerically elegant since the colloidal free energy is analytic and, physically, the model can be used to study the role played by the strength and range of interactions on the formation of coexisting phases.",Method
"In view of the mathematical simplicity and the transparency of the underlying theory, we have adopted in the present study of phase separation a model system that has much relevance to real physical systems.",Method

R2PI spectroscopy with mass selection has been used to record the S0–S1 spectrum.,Method
UV/UV SHB was applied to analyze the number of conformers present in the molecular beam.,Method
"To obtain further information on the conformer structure, R(1 + 1′)PI PES was performed for the two most intense S0–S1 transitions.",Method
In the BO approach the propagation involves the nuclear degrees of freedom which are treated classically.,Method
"Two decades ago, Car and Parrinello proposed a new approach that involved a new degree of freedom in the dynamics, namely the wave function.",Method
"Thus, the CPU time is reduced and larger molecular systems might be treated as compared to the BO approach.",Method
These algorithms were developed to study and predict equilibrium and non-equilibrium properties of condensed-matter systems.,Method
"On the other hand, the restriction to DFT methods is sometimes not judicious for chemical investigations.",Method
"Although the necessary integrals are more difficult to calculate, particularly two-electron integrals, efficient algorithms are available to perform this task.",Method
Using only atom centred basis functions within the CP scheme has been initially proposed by Field in the context of simulated annealing calculations.,Method
First CP dynamics using this type of basis set have been accounted for within the Hartree–Fock (HF) and generalised valence bond (GVB) methods.,Method
"Nevertheless, this scheme has shown some difficulty with energy conservation.",Method
"Moreover, Carter’s group decided to give up the CP molecular dynamics considering that it is less efficient than the BO style dynamics.",Method
This method has proven its ability in treating complex chemical systems with good accuracy.,Method
"We decided to reconsider the Carter et al., approach by combining the advantages of using Gaussian type orbitals for electronic structure calculation and the benefit of coupled propagation of the nuclei and the wave function.",Method
It is important to note that the implementation presented here is not a real CP method in the sense that a partial convergence of the minimisation energy procedure is achieved at each step.,Method
"In the present procedure, we are using the advantage of propagating the wave function by means of a CP type Lagrangian in order to reduce the computational time needed for an accurate description of the molecular dynamics.",Method
"Because of the propagation of the wave function between two different nuclear structures, a small fixed number of iterations (between two and three) is sufficient to obtain enough accuracy on gradients evaluation.",Method
This approach is different from converging the wave function at each given propagation step (for example 50 or 100) in the sense that numerical error accumulation does not appear abruptly.,Method
Moreover this partial convergence has the supplementary advantage of obtaining a dynamical accuracy that is close to the BO approach where the minimisation energy procedure is fulfilled at each step.,Method
The phase diagrams are determined by measuring the temperature dependence of the refractive index in the two phases of samples of critical composition.,Method
"While in ref. 1, separation temperatures were determined by visual inspection when cooling down homogenous mixtures, in this work, we investigate flame sealed samples of critical composition by a laser technique.",Method
We determine the refractive index of the coexisting phases and of the one-phase region as function of the temperature applying the minimum beam deflection method.,Method
"This highly accurate method allows determining critical exponents, which cannot be achieved by the visual method applied in ref. 1 and in the work of other authors, who reported phase diagrams of other RTILs in alcohol solutions.",Method
In samples of critical composition we determine the refractive index in the homogeneous phase above Tc and in the two phases below Tc using the minimum beam deflection method.,Method
"For the heterogeneous study, cyclic voltammetry with basal plane pyrolytic graphite electrodes modified with microdroplets of benzonitrile/TCBQ was employed.",Method
"Finally, the cross-phase electron transfer across the benzonitrile|water interface was examined when the TCBQ microdroplets were purposely made conductive by addition of a hydrophobic, nonpartitioning electrolyte in the oil phase.",Method
"The voltammetry associated with microdroplets has been shown to be very sensitive to the nature and concentration of ions in the surrounding aqueous phase as, in order to preserve charge neutrality within the unsupported microdroplets oil environment, ion insertion into or expulsion from the oil phase must take place during the Faradaic current flow.",Method
"In the first part, the well-documented electrochemical reduction of a hydrophobic benzoquinone derivative, p-chloranil (2,3,5,6-tetrachloro-1,4-benzoquinone, TCBQ), will be examined in homogeneous solutions of various aprotic solvents (namely: benzonitrile (BN), N,N,dimethylformamide (DMF), propylcyanide (PrCN) and dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO)).",Method
"In the second part, the redox chemistry of TCBQ will be further explored in the form of TCBQ/BN microdroplets immobilized at a bppg electrode surface immersed in various electrolyte solutions.",Method
"More recently, both the tert-2-hydroxycarboxylate ‘head’ group of naH6 (O1,O2) in addition to the glycerol ‘tail’ (O7,O8,O9) have been established as viable chelates of select transition metal ions using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy, NMR spectroscopy, or potentiometry; EPR spectroscopy in particular continues to emerge as a powerful tool in studying metal–bioligand speciation.",Method
"These observations were investigated using EPR simulation procedures. The parent Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 signals (at pH values ≥ 4.49) simulated (correlation > 0.998) as comprising two singlets, two quartets, two septets (Table 1) and up to five additional high-field singlets (present in very low (<3.5%) concentrations at pH values ≥ 7.14).",Method
"The system was composed of a microchip with a Y-shaped microchannel and a dam structure, polystyrene microbeads, and a thermal lens microscope (TLM).",Method

The antigen-antibody reaction time was shortened by the microchip integration.,Method
"Immunoassay, represented by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), is a well-known and important analytical method in the life sciences.",Method
It is an indispensable technique in biochemistry and clinical diagnosis fields because of its extremely high specificity and sensitivity.,Method
"The conventional heterogeneous immunoassay, however, has a relatively long assay time, and involves troublesome liquid-handling procedures and many expensive antibody reagents.",Method
"Moreover, automated assay systems used for clinical diagnoses require rather large apparatuses.",Method
"Most were preliminary reports that only mentioned the possibility of immunosorbent assay or an antigen-antibody reaction in a microfabricated device, however, we described a microchip-based immunosorbent assay system for determinations of some proteins with high sensitivity.",Method
"In that paper, we showed the reaction time necessary for an antigen-antibody reaction was reduced to 1/90 in the integrated system, because of size effects of the liquid microspace.",Method
The system provided rapid and sensitive determination and showed a high correlation with the conventional assay in practical measurements of patients' sera.,Method
"In the system, colloidal gold fixed on the surface of microbeads via an antigen-antibody complex was detected by focused laser beams.",Method
"Although the method had high sensitivity, the precision was poor because of the difficulty in focusing the laser onto the top of spherical surface and the heterogeneity of the protein adsorption and antigen-antibody reaction on the small areas of the beads.",Method
"Therefore, for determination of one sample, 5–10 beads had to be measured with the TLM while the laser was successively focused on the top of each bead and then the average was taken.",Method
"In this paper, an ELISA system was integrated into a microchip, in which peroxidase was used as a labeling material instead of colloidal gold and an enzyme reaction product was detected in a microchannel with the TLM.",Method
"The current work constitutes an investigation of smaller fluoride–ammonia clusters, with up to three ammonias bound to a fluoride anion.",Method
Our choice of computational methodology is guided by previous studies of the water–halide clusters.,Method
Only the valence electrons were correlated in the MP2 and MP4 calculations.,Method
"MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ and MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ calculations were undertaken for F−–(NH3)2, while MP2/aug-cc-pVDZ calculations were performed for F−–(NH3)3 clusters.",Method
Corrections to the intermolecular interaction energy arising from basis set superposition error (BSSE) were estimated using the method of Boys and Bernardi.,Method
Harmonic vibrational frequencies were computed analytically at the same level of theory used for the geometry optimisations.,Method
"It should be remembered that the calculated vibrational frequencies overestimate the actual frequencies, due to not taking anharmonicity into account.",Method
NBO analyses were performed on the clusters to determine the extent of H-bonding.,Method
Enthalpy changes for the ligand association reactions at 298 K were estimated using the method described in .ref. 53.,Method
"Low temperature fluorescence line-narrowing (FLN) and spectral hole-burning experiments (SHB) were performed in the 2E←4A2 spin–flip transition of [Cr(2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridine)2]3+ in frozen ethylene glycol/water (2 ∶ 1) and DMSO/water (2 ∶ 1) glasses.",Method
Often it can be overcome by the application of laser techniques such as fluorescence line narrowing (FLN) and spectral hole-burning (SHB).,Method
Discrimination between neurochemical and macromolecular signals in human frontal lobes using short echo time proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy.,Method
"Magnetic resonance spectra from large (35 cm3) frontal lobe voxels in vivo were analyzed using LCModel, with and without subtraction of a “metabolite nulled” spectrum with an inversion time of 650 ms to characterize the macromolecule baseline.",Method
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy can estimate the in vivo concentration of several important chemicals in the brain.,Method
"LCModel is a commercially available fitting package, which estimates the concentration of chemicals in the brain with reference to their individual spectra acquired using highly concentrated solutions.",Method
"This provides estimates of the separate concentrations in vivo of Glu and Gln, and of their combined signal Glx, along with estimates of the uncertainty in these concentrations, based on Cramer–Rao lower bounds.",Method
"The reliability of measurement of Glx is typically better than that of its individual components, and glutamine in particular would be considered generally to be unreliably determined in vivo.",Method
One method to discriminate signals from macromolecules and neurochemicals is through their different spin-lattice (T1) relaxation times.,Method
"Therefore, spectroscopic acquisition can be preceded by an inversion pulse with a delay chosen to null the signal from one while maintaining signal from the other.",Method
"It is possible to suppress the lipids and macromolecules directly, using an inversion pulse with a short delay.",Method
A better approach is to null the signal from small metabolites while maintaining signal from macromolecules.,Method
The fraction of signal remaining (S/S0) at each inversion time (TI) is calculated from the estimated T1 of each species and the repetition time (TR) as: S/S0 = 1 – 2 exp(–TI/T1) + exp(–TR/T1)The resulting macromolecule-weighted spectrum can be subtracted from the original trace to leave a spectrum with only signal from small neurochemicals remaining.,Method
"Although this method of metabolite nulling has been demonstrated to be capable of separating out the macromolecule signal, it is not widely used in vivo, due to the doubled scan time, and the reduction in signal-to-noise ratio inherent in performing a subtraction.",Method
"However, when estimating cerebral concentrations of especially glutamate and glutamine, signal-to-noise is not as limiting as macromolecule signal overlap, so the benefits of this approach may outweigh the drawbacks.",Method
"Theoretical methods, in particular Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, can provide valuable complementary information not accessible to experimental approaches both in the characterization of ion–solvent complexes and in the specific mechanism of the involved interactions.",Method
"With regard to this point, various schemes have been proposed, for example, the polarizable continuum model (PCM), which incorporates the many-body interactions in an average way, or a direct approach by calculating the energy hypersurface of many-body interactions and then fitting them to an analytical function.",Method
"To describe molecular interactions correctly, more sophisticated simulation technique incorporating quantum mechanical algorithms, namely the combined quantum mechanical and molecular mechanical (QM/MM) method has been introduced.",Method
"Several hybrid QM/MM models combine either semiempirical, density functional, valence bond, or even ab initio Hartree–Fock methodology with commonly used force fields.",Method
"In recent years, a “Born–Oppenheimer ab initio QM/MM dynamics” has been proposed and successfully applied for elucidating structural and dynamical properties of various ions in solutions.",Method
"This technique treats the active-site region, i.e. the solvation shell around the ion, quantum mechanically, while the environment consisting of further solvent molecules is described by classical molecular mechanical potentials.",Method
"By this approach, the complicated many-body contributions as well as the polarization effects within the solvation sphere of the ion can be reliably included.",Method
"For ion solvation in mixed solvent systems, Born–Oppenheimer ab initio QM/MM molecular dynamics simulations have been successfully applied to Li+, Na+, Mg2+ and Ca2+ in aqueous ammonia solution.",Method
The results from QM/MM simulations have provided more reliable geometrical arrangements of the solvated ion structures as well as ligand preferences in good agreement with the qualitative expectation according to Lewis acid–base interactions.,Method
"These include assessments of its vibrational frequencies, ordering of orbital energies, formation of inclusion compounds, NMR spin–spin coupling constants, and heat of formation.",Method
"Theoretical work in this area was pioneered by Pyykkö, who used Hartree–Fock (HF) and perturbation theory (MP2) methods to study the aurophilicity (metallophilicity between gold atoms) in [X–Au–PH3]2 dimers, where X is one from a range of groups such as the halogens, methyl and SCH3.",Method
"The structure studied in most detail was the C2 symmetric arrangement shown in Fig. 1a, in which the P1–Au1–Au2–P2 dihedral angle is fixed at 90° in order to zero the leading dipole–dipole term between the two monomers, and hence to allow more unencumbered focus on the aurophilicity.",Method
"Further insight has more recently been gained from the work of Schütz, Werner et al., which focuses on the use of the local MP2 (LMP2) approach.",Method
Schwerdtfeger and co-workers have recently examined metallophilicity using traditional MP.2.,Method
"Pyykkö et al. used MP2, MP3 and MP4(SDQ) to study [H–Au–PH3]2 and [Cl–Au–PH3]2, extending their [H–Au–PH3]2 calculations to the CCSD and CCSD(T) levels.",Method
"They found that the values of the interaction energy oscillated quite strongly as the higher level methods were introduced, and noted “this area will require further investigation”.",Method
We have also conducted density functional theory calculations.,Method
DFT has a reputation for producing the correct answer for unreliable reasons.,Method
"The former can be probed with linearly polarised light, and have been the subject of many investigations into the alignment of product angular momentum with respect to a reference axis.",Method
"However, such measurements give us no insight into the sense of this angular momentum.",Method
The use of circularly polarised light overcomes this difficulty and allows orientation parameters to be measured.,Method
Powder XRD spectra were collected on a Siemens Kristalloflex Mod.F (Ni-filtered Cu Kα).,Method

"Experiments were carried out using two different techniques, the relative rate method and the pulsed laser photolysis-laser induced fluorescence technique.",Method
The pulsed laser photolysis–laser induced fluorescence (PLP-LIF) technique was used to determine the absolute rate coefficients for the above reactions in the temperature range 241–373 K at around 100 Torr while the relative method enabled us to conduct the measurements at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.,Method

"Accordingly, the fate of the photoexcited molecules is controlled by conical intersections between the usually strongly absorbing first excited 1ππ* state, a neighboring optically dark 1πσ* state, and the S0 electronic ground state.",Method
The key role in the ensuing dynamics is played by the πσ* state which becomes repulsive along the NH or OH stretching coordinates and intersects the S0 state at long NH/OH bond lengths because the latter does not adiabatically correlate with the respective dissociation products in their electronic ground states.,Method

Sequential DNA hybridisation assays by fast micromixing.,Method
Fluorescent labelling techniques are predominantly used to identify the sites where probe and target sequences match.,Method
The performance of DNA microarrays is impressive as integration with microsystem technology progresses to increase the number of probe oligomer per unit area.,Method
"Thereby, the information density is increased considerably and enables large-scale genomic analysis such as gene expression profiling of whole organisms.",Method
"Although it seems that many application needs in industrial research and high-throughput screening can be satisfied with microarrays, there is an on-going interest in alternative DNA hybridisation technology, e.g. hybridisation-based sensors that depend on other sensing devices like fiber optics, surface plasmon resonance sensors or acoustic wave sensors.",Method
Especially attractive solutions were presented particle-based probe oligomer immobilisation schemes.,Method
"Yamashita et al. proposed a microfluidic system based totally on laminar flow, where the DNA hybridisation occurs at the interface between the streams.",Method
"By tailoring the geometry of channel bends on their chip, only the newly formed and fluorescence-labelled DNA duplexes migrate into the bulk region of the second laminar stream for detection.",Method
Another interesting contribution from Tamiya's group suggested the use of silicon micromachining to create platelet-like particles for immobilisation whose shape characteristics alone could code for different functionalisation and still be easily identifiable in mixtures.,Method
"However, there is a distinct lack of scale-up potential towards high-throughput applications in most of these approaches.",Method
"In some cases, the beads coated with probes could be sorted into a silicon frame and became individually addressable.",Method
We wish to present a different approach with potential for high-throughput application by combining purely solution-based DNA hybridisation reactions with the use of a microfluidic system.,Method
This device overcomes the mixing problem that is inherent to most microfluidic systems which work in the laminar flow regime and is based on the fine distribution of two laminar inlet flows (Fig. 1).,Method
"Potentially, this technology could allow for many thousand assays within just a few hours.",Method
"By using solution-based DNA chemistry, the need for immobilisation schemes is eliminated.",Method
In this study we present a refined optical detection technique for investigation of fast reactions based on confocal fluorescence spectroscopy in a miniaturized continuous flow (μCF) reactor.,Method
The special setup allows for simultaneous observation of the reaction on the basis of fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) as an indicator of the reaction progress.,Method
"Determination of the flow velocity via spatial fluorescence cross-correlation enables the conversion of spatial information, i.e. the position of the detection point, into the respective temporal information.",Method
"To overcome the disadvantage of conventional continuous flow reactors of high sample consumption, we used a microfluidic chip allowing an economical expenditure of sample solution at low concentration, while the silicon/glass chip is perfectly adaptable to the confocal setup.",Method
Time-resolved kinetic studies of chemical and biochemical processes provide essential information for a detailed understanding of molecular interaction and reaction mechanisms.,Method
"However, many of these reactions occur on very short time scales that render an appropriate time resolution particularly hard for conventional techniques of data collection.",Method
"Thus, a wide variety of techniques have been proposed in the past and developed for the initiating and probing of fast reactions in the time scale of microseconds and below, such as relaxation techniques for reversible reactions induced by temperature or pressure jumps, or flash photolysis for light-induced reactions.",Method
"For the observation of fluid-based reactions in general, continuous and stopped flow methods were introduced quite early on  and since then have been constantly improved with respect to temporal resolution from a few seconds down to the submicrosecond regime.",Method
"The beauty of the continuous flow kinetics is the concept of transforming the temporal information into a spatial one, supporting the simultaneous observation of a system at different time points by spatially resolved detection.",Method
"In spite of their conceptual elegance, continuous flow experiments usually suffer from the practical drawback that large amounts of sample solution are consumed during the experiment, which has in the past limited their applications.",Method
"Here, a fast sheath flow of reactant A from two side channels merges with the flow in a middle channel containing another reactant B, thereby focussing the solution in this central zone down to a thin layer (see also the schematic drawing in Fig. 1, right inset).",Method
The control parameter in these mixing devices is the ratio of flow rates in the side and main channels.,Method
The characteristic mixing time for this so-called hydrodynamic focussing depends on the size of the flow layers as well as on the molecular diffusion coefficients of the sample.,Method
"After initiating the reaction by mixing, a crucial requirement to investigate fast reaction dynamics is a high spatial resolution of the readout process along the channel.",Method
"In addition, proper readout parameters have to be defined which reliably reflect the reaction progress, and which can be determined with high sensitivity to avoid delays due to signal accumulation.",Method
"Furthermore, to precisely translate the spatial position of the observation points along the channel to the exact time points of the reaction, the control and knowledge of the flow velocity is indispensable.",Method
"Cross-correlation analysis of the signals results in a curve with a distinct maximum, corresponding to the average time that a molecule needs to travel the distance between both excitation volumes.",Method
"Contrary to alternative imaging techniques, dual-beam cross-correlation in a confocal setup allows for very sensitive analysis, and for real-time monitoring of the flow velocity with high spatial resolution.",Method
"In this sense, the theoretical analysis described in the first part of the present work indicated that it is necessary for the application of diagnostic criteria and/or appropriate methodologies for the evaluation of the kinetic parameters characteristics of the HER from the analysis of the experimental results corresponding to the hydrogen oxidation.",Method
The proposed methodology is applied for the study of the hydrogen oxidation on a rotating disc electrode (RDE) of polycrystalline platinum.,Method
Most striking has been the synonymous advent of real-time PCR and delivery of a robust quantitative gene measuring tool.,Method
"However, the post-genome era brings with it new problems and exposes old fissures that have undermined the application of PCR.",Method
The scaling-up of pre-existing procedures for higher throughput would be inappropriate for continuous environmental monitoring and population studies.,Method
"Miniaturisation of PCR integrated bioassays potentially possesses all of the desired qualities and comes with additional benefits relating to sample tracking, contamination, and savings in finances and time.",Method
"However, most PCR experimental testing to date does not clearly relate the gene content measured to the contribution made by all specific cell types.",Method
"Increasingly the need to analyse from the single cell is gaining in popularity, and once again the packaging and process offered by integrated miniaturised PCR offers great promise.",Method
"Although this geometrical model has been successfully applied in a number of cases, it does not account for the finite size of the (molecular) elements in the system.",Method
"As a continuum model, the geometrical approach implicitly relies on a sample size well exceeding the size of its molecular constituents; this approximation therefore must break down when the sample size is on the order of typical molecular diameter.",Method
"For very small samples, a local, statistical description for the growth would seem more appropriate.",Method
"The simple way for this purpose is to immobilize directly naturally-occurring glycoconjugates such as glycoproteins and glycolipids on a substrate; however, this is not suitable for studying the role of the carbohydrate itself such as in molecular recognition.",Method
"It was developed to immobilize only the synthetic sugar chains on a substrate by using chemical methods such as Diels–Alder reactions and activated esterification; however, it required complicated chemical treatments such as the selective protection and de-protection of certain functional hydroxyl groups.",Method
"It is also common to achieve the immobilization through a Schiff's base linkage using an aldehyde group of a reducing end of a carbohydrate with an amine or hydrazide group; however, this method has a disadvantage of collapsing the reducing end.",Method
"The state and orientation of the sialylglycan on the QCM chip was confirmed by binding of SSA lectin from Sambucus sieboldiana, which is known to recognize specifically the NeuAc(α2-6)Gal/GalNAc sequence of carbohydrate chains of glycoconjugates [step (c) in Fig. 1].",Method

"The evaluation of electron repulsion integrals (ERI) over basis functions a,b,c,d(ab|cd) = ∫ a(r1)b(r1)r12−1c(r2)d(r2)dτis a basic task in molecular electronic structure methods.",Method
The computation of ERIs is typically the dominant step in HF (Hartree–Fock) and DFT (density functional theory) treatments of molecules if the electronic energy is computed exactly within a basis set expansion of molecular orbitals.,Method
The RI (resolution of the identity) technique is a proven procedure for this purpose.,Method
"Other procedures have been developed for the very same purpose, such as CFMM (continuous fast multipole moment) in combination with the J engine method and Fourier techniques.",Method
"Multipole moment methodology can also be exploited within RI, thus combining the advantages of both procedures.",Method
"The results of a far infrared (FIR) investigation were interpreted in terms of planarity of the molecule, whereas a single vibronic level fluorescence (SVLF) study suggested that the molecule is non-planar, with the barrier to planarity attributed to a twisting motion at the oxygen atoms in positions 1 and 3.",Method
The studies reported in refs. 5–7 combined the analysis of far-infrared and Raman spectra with that of laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) from electronic transitions between the ground (S0) and the first excited electronic (S1) states.,Method
"Analysis using a 2D model comprising of ring-puckering and butterfly motions, was performed in refs. 6 and 7 although some unusually large discrepancies between the observed and the calculated transition frequencies were obtained.",Method

A number of different methods have been proposed for the synthesis of qualitative and mixed-methods findings such as the ones we typically find in software engineering (SE) (see [15] for an overview).,Method
" Many of the these methods have much in common with meta-ethnography, as originally described by Noblit and Hare [37], and used in SE by Dybå and Dingsøyr [21].",Method
" This method involves identifying key concepts from primary studies, comparing and translating them into higher-order interpretations.",Method

" Of these, thematic analysis stands out as it represents a range of potential methods for research synthesis that can be used with most, if not all, qualitative methods [8].",Method
" Thematic analysis is also one of the most frequently used synthesis methods in SE; in a previous study we found that two-thirds of the systematic reviews in SE that synthesize their primary studies, performed a narrative or thematic analysis [15].",Method
"Recently, Thomas and Harden developed a new approach called thematic synthesis [42], which draws on the principles of thematic analysis and other established methods in primary qualitative research.",Method

"With this configuration, monomer structures in a dimer stay roughly as observed in X-ray structures at all bond separations, and therefore the nature of internal bonding in a dimer can be investigated without causing artificial distortion of the monomers at all distances.",Model
Geometries were then fully optimized apart from one constraint which is the C–C inter-monomer distance (R) corresponding to the reaction coordinate for dimer formation or scission.,Model

"Quantitatively, σ2 for porphyrins in the near-IR excitation wavelength region may be calculated in the so-called single intermediate state approximation.",Model
This is because the real intermediate level (the first Q-band) in porphyrins is close to the excitation wavelength (λex = 780 nm).,Model
"As a result, the contribution of this level into the two-photon cross section dominates over the rest of the intermediate levels.  discusses the application of the single intermediate level model to porphyrins in detail.",Model
"In the framework of this model, the two-photon cross section is proportional to: Here, subscripts 0, i and f refer to the ground, intermediate, and final excited states, respectively, Mi0 and Mif are the 0 → i and i → f transition dipole moments, respectively, Γ is the half width at the half maximum of the 0 → i transition, g(2νp) is the normalized lineshape function (in Hz–1), proportional to the cross-sectional contour of the final state, νp and νi0 are the photon frequency and the frequency of the 0 → i transition.",Model
"By applying the above formula to both dimer and monomer, we can express the ratio of the two cross sections as: where superscript D and M refer to dimer and monomer, respectively.",Model
"The three main factors contributing to the large TPA cross section of the dimer are the resonance enhancement term [(νi0 – νp)2 + Γ2]–1, the 0 → i transition dipole squared |Mi0|2, and the product of the i → f transition dipole squared and the normalized lineshape function |Mif|2g(2νp).",Model

The impedance models are usually represented by a repetitive spatial arrangement (transmission line) involving resistances and capacitors.,Model
"These elements pertain to the kinetic model that combines transport, reaction (or recombination) and charge accumulation processes.",Model
Impedance models have been developed to treat these situations.,Model
"The transmission line model used previously1,2 is indicated in Fig. 1c.",Model
"It corresponds to the expression where Rt is the diffusion resistance, Rrec is the recombination resistance, ωd = Dn/L2 is the characteristic frequency of diffusion in a finite layer (Dn being the electron diffusion coefficient), ωk is the rate constant for recombination, ω is the angular frequency and .",Model
The model of eqn. (1) is valid for homogeneous elements in the transmission line.,Model
"In addition, eqn. (1) considers only the modulation of the gradient of the Fermi level1 and not the current generators associated to position-dependent conductivity, as commented further below.",Model
"With these simplifications, the transmission line model can be solved analytically.",Model
"In the conditions of low recombination, Rt ≪ Rk, eqn. (1) reduces to the expression.",Model
"On the other hand, in conditions of large recombination, Rt ≫ Rk, the general impedance of eqn. (1) becomes the Gerischer impedance.",Model
Fig. 2 shows the impedance shapes corresponding to the transmission line model of Fig. 1c.,Model
"Curves 1–5 are well described by eqn. (2), while curves 7–8 correspond to Gerischer impedance in eqn. (3).",Model
"All impedances show at high frequency a diffusion line of slope 1, which is implied by eqn. (1), Z(ω) ∝ (iω)−1/2 at ω ≫ ωk.",Model

"This is clear from the structures shown in Fig. 1, which compares the experimental results for furan⋯HCl, furan⋯HBr and benzene⋯HBr.",Model
"In this theory, the colloid–colloid potential is split into two parts: a repulsive part modeled by the hard-core potential and an attractive part modeled by the square-well potential corrected by a linear tail.",Model
The effect of the strength of the interaction can be accounted for by varying the width of the square-well potential (simulated by γ parameter) while the range of the interaction—by changing the “slope” of the linear potential (simulated by λ parameter).,Model
"In this method, the free energy functional was constructed in terms of the one and two particle density distribution functions, both for the liquid and solid counterparts.",Model

Of particular importance are the following chemical reactions: O(1D2) + H2O → 2 OHO(1D2) + N2O → 2 NOO(1D2) + N2O → N2 + O2Reaction (3) is the single most important primary source of HOx radicals in the troposphere while reaction (4a) is the dominant primary source of NOx radicals in the stratosphere.,Model
"Assuming that atmospheric destruction of O(1D2) is completely dominated by reactions (1) and (2) (reaction (3) can actually make a small but significant contribution under humid lower tropospheric conditions), eqns. (I) and (II) can be readily derived to represent the production rates of tropospheric HOx and stratospheric NOx, respectively: d[HOx]/dt = 2J[O3]k3[H2O]/(k1[N2] + k2[O2])d[NOx]/dt = 2J[O3]k4a[N2O]/(k1[N2] + k2[O2])In the above equations, J represents the first order rate coefficient for production of atmospheric O(1D2) via O3 photodissociation, i.e., d[O(1D2)]/dt = J[O3].",Model

The electronic degree of freedom chosen for the propagation are the coefficients of the linear combination of atomic orbitals development where atomic orbitals are expressed upon Gaussian functions.,Model
The associated Lagrangian includes all the usual terms (the electronic and kinetic nuclear energy) plus a term that allows the classical propagation of the wave function.,Model
"Consequently, the nuclear degrees of freedom and the wave function evolve according to the Newton law and the minimisation energy procedure can be normally avoided.",Model
"Since the appearance of the CP method, most of the algorithms are based on the density functional theory (DFT) approach coupled with a plane wave basis set description of the electronic structure.",Model

The number of basis functions needed to describe molecular orbitals with a good accuracy is far smaller than with plane wave functions.,Model
Recently a different CP molecular dynamics approach has been proposed where the dynamics variables chosen to represent the electronic degree of freedom are the individual elements of the reduced one-particle density matrix expressed with Gaussian orbitals.,Model
"Instead of using a density matrix scheme, we use the original CP Lagrangian.",Model
"Consequently, the dynamics variables chosen to represent the electronic degree of freedom in this approach are the molecular orbitals ψi.",Model
"By means of a Verlet scheme, the nuclear coordinates and the coefficients of the LCAO development of each molecular orbital are jointly propagated in order to reproduce an accurate dynamical behaviour of the molecular system.",Model

"The electrostatic effects of the environment, which are expected to strongly affect the CI topology, are accounted for by a dielectric continuum model.",Model
"At the level of description adopted here (which allows for considerable generalization), the model involves (i) a description of the environment as a dielectric continuum (Section 2) which translates to a solvent coordinate picture, previously exploited in models for charge transfer reactions strongly coupled to large amplitude nuclear motion, see e.g.refs. 7, 25–29, in conjunction with (ii) a representation of the chromophore's electronic structure in a diabatic basis of states which are constructed such as to preserve their charge character in the nonadiabatic coupling region.",Model
This type of basis is best adapted to formulate the interaction with a polar and polarizable environment.,Model
"(The term diabatic is here meant in a loose sense, to describe a basis which has “smooth” properties and approximately diagonalizes the nuclear kinetic energy operator.)",Model
"In this first effort, we focus on a simple realization of such a basis in terms of valence bond (VB) type states suitable for the description of PSBs, as an extension of the two-electron two-orbital model by Bonačić-Koutecký, Koutecký, and Michl (Section 3).",Model

Application interest for anions with very high dissociation capabilities exists e.g. as counter-ions for metal catalysts in organic synthesis and in modern non-aqueous (liquid and solid) electrolytes for lithium batteries.,Motivation

It is therefore relevant to ask the question whether HF atoms are too large or too small.,Motivation
Structure–activity correlations of solid catalysts and time-resolved studies generally require that the structure within a solid catalyst is probed simultaneously and at the same location where the catalysis and the structural changes occur.,Motivation
These requirements lead to a compromise between the spectroscopic arrangement and the optimum design for an in situ reactor cell.,Motivation
Both goals require in situ investigations and the design of appropriate in situ cells for simultaneous structural and catalytic studies.,Motivation
"In particular, techniques based on X-rays (X-ray diffraction, scattering techniques, X-ray absorption) have been used,4,8,9,13–16 since in situ cells can be constructed that mimic conditions close to the reaction conditions, even in liquid phase or at high pressure.",Motivation
"However, none of the studies compared the advantages and limitations of the different cell designs to provide truly in situ EXAFS studies, both under dynamic and static conditions.",Motivation

"Structure 2, with its intriguing C–C separation that is too short for a van der Waals complex but astonishingly long for a C–C bond, may represent an emerging class of organic molecules that possess unusually long C–C bonding interactions.",Motivation
"Perhaps due to the unusual nature of the interaction, electronic structure calculations to date have not yielded binding energies and C–C distances in good agreement with experiment.",Motivation
"This is firstly to do with differences between the models studied and experiment, because typically no explicit counter-ions are present in the calculated potential energy curves (although estimates of their stabilizing effect have been made).",Motivation
Additionally the deviations can also be associated with limitations in the computational methods.,Motivation

Particularly interesting is the competition between H-bonding and π-bonding and its consequences on the cluster growth.,Motivation
"As Ar and N2 are weak proton acceptors, proton transfer from 1-Np+ to the solvent may not be expected in D0 even for complete solvation.",Motivation
"(2) As the ability of the OH group to form H-bonds to a ligand is correlated with its acidity, the EI-IR spectra of H-bound 1-Np+–L dimers directly probe the acidity of both 1-Np+ rotamers and eventually enable a first estimate of the unknown proton affinity of the 1-naphthoxy radical.",Motivation
The detection of c-1-Np+–(N2)n in the present work corresponds to the first observation of c-1-Np+ complexes and enables thus direct comparison of both 1-Np+ rotamers.,Motivation
(3) Comparison of 1-Np+–Ln with Ph+–Ln and H2O+–Ln reveals the influence of substitution of a mono- and bicyclic aromatic ring on the acidity of ROH+ cations.,Motivation
The electrochemical reduction of oxygen to form hydrogen peroxide is of wide interest.,Motivation
Electrode modification for electro-catalysis of oxygen reduction is popular since through immobilisation onto electrode surfaces via physically or covalent attachment electrocatalytic activities can be significantly improved.,Motivation

"These structures have shed light on the atomic details of the covalent reaction intermediate, but it is less clear in which conformation the sugar of the −1 subsite is bound in the Michaelis complex.",Motivation
"The ambiguity is mainly due to difficulties in finding suitable substrates, which are not hydrolysed, occupy at the same time subsites also at the reducing end (+1) of the binding site, and are structurally similar to the natural substrates.",Motivation
Knowledge of the energetics involved in the substrate binding in different conformations can be obtained with computer simulations and further our understanding on factors responsible for enzyme-catalysed reactions.,Motivation
"Amyloid-like fibrils formed from de novo designed short peptides, made up a nanoscale scaffold on which streptavidin was arranged in a regular spacing, potentially allowing the development into an array technology utilizing bio-nanoconstructs.",Motivation

"From the equilibrium mass loading of the cadmium ions (48 µg cm−2) in the thin film and the knowledge of the AOT mass deposited initially, an AOT ∶ Cd2+ molar ratio of 1 ∶ 42 was calculated.",Result
The above observation clearly indicates considerable overcompensation of the negative charge due to the sulfate groups in the AOT matrix by the Cd2+ ions.,Result
This ‘apparently’ large charge overcompensation could also be due to a large change in the acoustic properties of the AOT film consequent to Cd2+ entrapment.,Result
The initial mass loss could be due to partial leaching out of the cadmium ions from the AOT film.,Result
"The mass increase observed thereafter could be explained on the basis that during formation of CdS, an uncharged entity, fresh sulfonate groups are regenerated leading to the possibility of complexation of positively charged Na+ ions within the film.",Result
Another possible contributing factor for the observed mass increase could be a large change in the acoustic properties of the composite nanoparticulate thin film of AOT with entrapped semiconducting nanoparticles.,Result
The changes in the acoustic properties could originate from a considerable change in the viscoelastic behavior during formation of CdS nanoparticles.,Result
"This absorption edge is blue-shifted relative to bulk form of CdS, which is known to occur at 510 nm.",Result
The blue-shift in the absorption edge observed here with AOT thin films is an indicator that the CdS nanoparticles formed within the AOT matrix are in the quantum dot regime.,Result
We would like to emphasize here that the size of the CdS nanoparticles grown in AOT thin films is significantly smaller than that observed in our earlier study on CdS growth in thermally evaporated stearic acid films where the absorption band edge was observed at 470 nm.,Result
"The spectrum corresponding to a pure AOT thin film represented as curve 1 in Fig. 2A showed peaks at 1160 and 1052 cm−1 corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric stretch vibrations of the sulfonate groups and at 1247 cm−1, which corresponds to the ester stretch (–C(O)–O–C).",Result
"After formation of CdS (curve 3, Fig. 2A), there is no further shift in the peak value corresponding to the S–O stretching vibrational mode indicating that the AOT molecules are still bound to the cadmium ions on the surface of the CdS nanocrystals or could possibly be due to the presence of Na+ ions as discussed above in relation to the observed QCM mass change.",Result
The intense peaks at 2854 and 2924 cm−1 corresponding to methylene antisymmetric and symmetric vibrational modes in AOT (curve 1) as shown in Fig. 2B are reduced in intensity after incorporation of Cd2+ ions (curve 2) and further reduced after formation of CdS (curve 3) indicating randomization in the orientation of the hydrocarbon chains consequent to ion entrapment.,Result
A quantitative analysis of the film revealed that the atomic ratio of Cd and S in the film was is ca. 1 ∶ 2.2.,Result
It should be noted here that the contribution of the S atoms in the EDAX spectrum comes from both S atoms present in the AOT molecules and from those in the CdS nanoparticles and would explain the larger than unity molar ratio of sulfur relative to cadmium.,Result
"While an exact estimate of the particle size cannot be made from this image, it is clear that the CdS nanoparticles are formed at sufficiently high density within the AOT film.",Result
"From this picture, it is clearly seen that the particles are essentially spherical and fairly monodisperse.",Result
"From a Gaussian fit to the histogram (solid line, Fig. 5B), an average CdS nanoparticle size 3 ± 0.6 nm was estimated.",Result
XRD measurement of the AOT thin film after incorporation of Cd2+ ions showed no lamellar ordering which is commonly observed in case of stearic acid or octadecyl amine.,Result
"For thin films, below one quarter sphere height, the spectra show a single reflectivity dip at a wavelength just below the sphere diameter consistent with surface-plasmon grating-like behaviour.",Result
For the thicker films several reflectivity dips are observed which move towards longer wavelength with increasing film thickness.,Result
"We do, however achieve this on a single micro bead which can be optically detected.",Result
Chiral recognition in the intramolecular induced quenching of the methoxynaphthalene triplet by benzophenone has been observed by using diastereomeric bichromophores.,Result
"The UV spectra of the bichromophoric compounds were merely the sum of the spectra of the individual chromophores, indicating little electronic interaction between the chromophores in the ground state (Fig. 1).",Result
"As expected, the shapes of the three emision spectra were identical due to the nonemissive nature of the benzophenone singlet state.",Result
"Thus, in the bichromophoric compounds the naphthalene singlet state is quenched by the benzophenone group, due to singlet–singlet energy transfer.",Result
"This must occur within the laser pulse duration, as evidenced by the transient absorption spectrum that corresponds to the triplet naphthalene-like chromophore (Fig. 3).",Result
"Thus, the 430 nm band decayed with first-order rate constants kd of 8.5 × 105 and 5.3 × 105 s–1 for (S,R)- and (S,S)-KP-NPX, respectively.",Result
"It is found that hydrogen-bonded networks around both H3O+ and H5O2+ cores can be stabilized in the protein matrix, leading to so-called Eigen and solvated Zundel complexes, H3O+· (H2O)3 and H5O2+·(H2O)4, respectively.",Result
"It turns out that both complexes behave qualitatively similarly to the gas phase, implying that the H5O2+ core displays an essentially symmetric hydrogen bond with the excess proton being equally shared between two water molecules.",Result
The dynamics of this hydrogen bond is found to be complex featuring slow large-amplitude motion of the central proton as well as complex dynamics of the protonated water cluster hydrogen bonds formed with the protein matrix.,Result
This emission is centred around 675 nm and can be assigned to phosphorescence from the lowest-energy MLCT triplet state of the metal complex.,Result
"Even so, emission is much more intense than that observed from the parent complex under these conditions.",Result
The corrected excitation spectrum matches the absorption spectrum over the entire visible and near-UV regions and all spectroscopic measurements indicate that only a single species emits.,Result
"As such, the temperature dependence is due to perturbation of the photophysical properties of the lowest-energy MLCT triplet state.",Result
"This expression provides for the activationless rate of decay (k0), seen at low temperature, and for coupling to two additional excited triplet states.",Result
This upper-lying state is probably a second MLCT triplet but with increased singlet character.,Result
The overall rate constant (k1) associated with reaching this state is rendered complex by the reversible nature of the barrier crossing.,Result
"In this case, barrier crossing is considered to be irreversible such that the derived rate constant (k2) is set by the rate of decay of the MC state.",Result
This latter process results in direct population of the ground state.,Result
It is seen that only k0 depends on the length of the strap.,Result
The fact that k0 depends on the length of the strap is clear indication that the conformation of the bridging unit affects the degree of electronic communication along the molecular axis.,Result
Two possibilities need be considered on the basis of molecular dynamics simulations made for the target compounds in a bath of acetonitrile molecules.,Result
"First, the strap controls the torsion angle between the phenylene rings.",Result
"Second, the strapped biphenylene unit does not lie coplanar with the covalently-linked terpyridine groups.",Result
This torsion angle controls the degree of electronic coupling between the terpyridine ligand and the ethynylene group and will have a pronounced effect on the extent of electron delocalisation over the acetylenic unit.,Result
"However, since ET remains invariant throughout this series it is clear that other factors combine to affect the magnitude of k0.",Result
The medium-frequency mode corresponds to CC and CN stetching vibrations associated with the terpyridine ligand.,Result
The low frequency vibration can be assigned to substituted phenylene bending modes.,Result
"The rate coefficients (measured in 10−18 cm3 molecule−1 s−1) were 1.58 ± 0.23 for crotonaldehyde, 1.59 ± 0.22 for trans-2-pentenal, 1.82 ± 0.26 for 3-methyl-2-butenal, 5.34 ± 0.73 for trans-2-methyl-2-butenal, 29.5 ± 4.1 for 3-pentene-2-one and 8.3 ± 1.1 for mesityl oxide.",Result
"A log–log plot of the rate coefficients measured in the present and previous works vs. the calculated results of the rate constants, showed a linear relationship.",Result
"We find that for those atoms for which the CASSCF wavefunction is distinct from the HF wavefunction, the Schrödinger values are distinctly smaller than the HF values.",Result
"Most other atoms are also smaller than the HF values, (or the same within a numerical uncertainty), the exceptions being the hard atoms N–Ne, and Cl, Ar and Kr.",Result
Indeed this analysis agrees with later results in this paper.,Result
"Dynamical correlation, which amongst other things is the main quantum mechanical origin of dispersion interactions, turns out to be critical in describing the TCNE22− dimerization as we discuss below.",Result
It is apparent that the interaction between the two K+TCNE−˙ monomers is overall dissociative at the PP(1) level.,Result
"This result is perhaps unexpected because, in previous literature on this interaction,2,3,7 the instability of a dimer arising from two TCNE−˙ units was ascribed to anion-anion Coulomb repulsions, but in our theoretical model these radical anions are now each neutralized by K+ ions (i.e., K+TCNE−˙ as in experiments) and yet they are still purely repulsive.",Result
It indicates that the interaction between two K+TCNE−˙ units cannot just be regarded as coupling between 2 “giant hydrogen-like radicals” since no bond is found when just two-electron bonding and antibonding interactions between the (neutralized) monomers are permitted.,Result
"The message that this result delivers is clear: Dispersion effects, as well as other attractive and repulsive forces, must be considered to correctly describe the π-dimerization of TCNE−˙.",Result
"These results (i.e., binding energy and equilibrium geometry) are in satisfactory agreement with recent experiments in solution and in the solid state, in which ΔH = −8.8 kcal mol−1 (−36.8 kJ mol−1) and Req = 2.9 Å (290 pm).",Result
"The fact that Req at CP-MRMP2 occurs at a slightly longer distance than for MRMP2 reflects the fact that without CP correction, the bond length is spuriously shortened due to BSSE.",Result
This metastable minimum is found to be spurious confirming that the dimer is bound only in the presence of counter-cations since it almost disappears (with a 0.6 kcal mol−1 barrier) when BSSE is corrected at CP-MRMP2.,Result
"Nontheless, the MRMP2 curve still shows that the dispersion interactions stabilized the dimer significantly.",Result
"Although crucial as shown above, dispersion forces are only one of the driving forces that allow dimer formation with this unusual 2.9 Å bondlength.",Result
"These four-center two-electron π-bonding interactions also help to allow the TCNE monomers to come well inside the usual van der Waals envelope, by partly compensating repulsive Coulomb and exchange interactions between filled orbitals that are responsible for normal van der Waals separations.",Result
"This means that the dimer has about 76% π-bonding character and 24% diradical character, which suggests that its bond order at this distance is 0..76.",Result
"Size-dependent frequency shifts of the O–H stretch vibration (Δν1) and photofragmentation branching ratios provide information about the stepwise microsolvation of both 1-Np+ rotamers in a nonpolar hydrophobic environment, including the formation of structural isomers, the competition between H-bonding and π-bonding, the estimation of ligand binding energies, and the acidity of t/c-1-Np+. t-1-Np+ is predicted to be more stable than c-1-Np+ by 9 kJ mol−1, with an isomerization barrier of 38 kJ mol−1.",Result
The 1-Np+−Ar spectrum displays ν1 bands of the more stable H-bound and the less stable π-bound t-1-Np+–Ar isomers.,Result
Only the more stable H-bound dimers are identified for t/c-1-Np+–L2.,Result
Analysis of the Δν1 shifts of the H-bound dimers yields a first experimental estimate for the proton affinity of the t-1-naphthoxy radical (∼908 ± 30 kJ mol−1).,Result

"In the reactive enzyme–substrate conformation, in which the catalytic groups are precisely positioned for the catalytic reaction, the −1 sugar moiety of the substrate adopted a B3,O (boat) conformation for CEX and a 2SO (skew-boat) conformation for BCX.",Result
Upon binding the internal energies of the reactive substrate conformations are increased by about 9 kJ mol−1.,Result
"In contrast to this, the internal energies of substrates in all-chair conformation are increased by 33–43 kJ mol−1, with somewhat larger increase for BCX than CEX.",Result
The result of ThT binding assay indicates that the β-structural peptides form amyloid-like fibrils.,Result
"These results showed that biotinylated peptides were incorporated into fibrils, and streptavidin molecules attached to the biotin groups on the fibril.",Result
This suggests that there is a correlation between the mixing ratio of two peptides at a random coil state and the existence ratio of biotin in the formed fibrils.,Result
"Hence, it can be ideally considered that one biotinylated peptide is preferably incorporated in every 100–120 peptides during fibrillogenesis.",Result
One of the possible explanations is that streptavidin would bind with plural biotin groups.,Result
"Sterptavidin has four binding sites for biotin, and would bind to plural biotin groups closely arranged in the fibrils, probably resulting in no observation of intervals less than 20 nm and in broad peaks in the histogram.",Result
Another speculation is that biotin groups could be exposed enough to bind streptavidin every 50 nm.,Result
"On the other hand, in our experiments the periodic binding of avidin to the fibrils was demonstrated, although the fibrils were formed from short peptides.",Result
Our results may arise from the purposefully designed peptide sequences considering the side-chain interactions to affect regular fibril formation.,Result
The peptides used in this study were also well designed considering the matching of the side-chain interactions between antiparallel β-strands to regulate the fibril formation.,Result
"It is conceivable that the formed fibrils have a regularity or periodicity in the fine structure, although the direct evidence such as helical twist could not be found in TEM images.",Result
"Therefore, the frequency of bound Au-Av particles on the fibrils consequently reflects the structural periodicity of fibrils owing to the regular peptide alignment.",Result
"In fact, the fluorophore-labelled avidin bound to the fibrils has enabled single fiber observation (data not shown).",Result
The saturated resonance frequency shift of the cantilever was proportional to the PSA antigen concentration of analyte solution.,Result
The resonance shift responses of the cantilever were a function of the PSA antigen–antibody reaction time and the PSA concentration.,Result
"The trapping efficiencies are comparable to those measured for particles in liquids, allowing the prolonged trapping and manipulation of droplets for timescales of hours.",Result
The trend in resonance wavelengths illustrates the increase in mode spacing with diminishing droplet size.,Result
"Indeed, the invariance of the resonant wavelengths with power also suggests that the refractive index of the droplet is constant, reinforcing the conclusion that there is no significant change in temperature.",Result
"A shift to shorter wavelength of 0.047 nm/K would be apparent if heating were occurring, reflecting the change in refractive index with temperature.",Result
"By applying the procedure adopted by Popp et al., this correlates with an increase in droplet temperature due to heating of 0.01 K under steady state conditions, consistent with the temperature invariance inferred from the experimental data.",Result

"The IR spectra of the In+–L dimers reveal two transitions, which are attributed to ν1 fundamentals of the H-bound and π-bound isomers on the basis of their complexation-induced ν1 frequency shifts, Δν1.",Result

"The In+–Ln complexes were generated in an electron impact (EI) ion source, which predominantly produces the most stable isomer of each cluster ion.",Result

In the spectra of the mixed solutions bands were detected that must be assigned to the 1∶1 complex between the ether and fluoroform.,Result
"The fluoroform C–H stretching in the complex is detected at 18.7 cm–1 above its value in monomer fluoroform, confirming the blue shifting hydrogen bonding in the complex.",Result
Analysis shows that the Raman intensity of this mode is not significantly affected by complexation.,Result
Bi-directional photocurrent generation dependent on the wavelength of irradiation of a mixed monolayer assembly.,Result
The direction of the photocurrent which is induced in the electrode when it is irradiated depends on the wavelength of the light used.,Result
"The reason for the lower coverage in the case of (RuVS + PcS)/Au is uncertain at present, but the photocurrent intensity correlates well with the surface coverage (vide infra).",Result
This suggests that the ruthenium complex is the photoactive species and the anodic photocurrent generation is mainly due to photoinduced intramolecular electron transfer from the photoexcited ruthenium complex to the viologen moiety.,Result
"The action spectrum also showed broad bands around 700 nm, corresponding to the absorption bands of phthalocyanine in toluene.",Result
"At E = –200 mV, the photocurrent from (RuVS + PcS)/Au was observed in the cathodic direction when exciting in the 400–750 nm region and the photocurrent action spectrum showed broad peaks around 630 and 700 nm; thus, the contribution from RuVS is negligible.",Result
"At E = +400 mV on the other hand, the photocurrent was observed only in the anodic direction when irradiating in the 400–750 nm region, with a relatively large broad peak around 450 nm, meaning that the contribution from PcS is negligible.",Result
"At E = 0 mV, however, photocurrents were observed in both directions, depending on the irradiation wavelength, as shown in Fig. 3.",Result
"The photocurrent action spectrum for (RuVS + PcS)/Au at E = 0 mV shows a broad anodic peak around 450 nm, corresponding with the absorption peak of RuVS, and two cathodic peaks around 630 and 700 nm, corresponding with the absorption peaks of PcS, with a cross-point (zero current) around 550 nm.",Result
These results indicate that oxygen is a good electron acceptor for the photoexcited phthalocyanine and the presence of oxygen promotes electron transfer from the photoexcited phthalocyanine to MV2+.,Result
The bi-directional photocurrent response reported here arises as a result of the implantation of two separate and individually functioning photoinduced electron-transfer systems on the electrode.,Result
We report strong cooperative enhancement of simultaneous two-photon absorption cross section in a porphyrin dimer.,Result
"This value is comparable to or even exceeds the largest simultaneous TPA cross sections measured for organic chromophores, and is certainly the largest value measured for a tetrapyrrolic molecule.",Result
The extended conjugation in the dimer manifests itself in a pronounced red shift of the absorption and fluorescence maxima relative to monomer.,Result
"The degree of the power dependence progressively increases with decreasing temperature (Fig. 2) because of the lowering of OPA, and turns into purely quadratic one at T = 20 K. However, analysis of these dependencies with the expression F(P) = aP + bP2 shows that the value of two-photon cross section, proportional to coefficient b does not depend on temperature.",Result
"This is not surprising, because, in contrast to OPA, two-photon transitions predominantly occur from the ground state and do not depend on the depletion of the thermally populated vibronic states.",Result
We thus obtained σ2 = (6 ± 1) × 103 GM. This constitutes one of the largest intrinsic molecular TPA cross section values known to date.,Result
"The obtained value, σ2 = 15 ± 4 GM, falls well in the range that is typical for regular porphyrins.",Result
"In this case, the excitation at 780 nm was sufficiently far away to the red from the closest Q-band absorption peak at 646 nm, such that no detectable OPA was present, even at room temperature.",Result
We conclude that the porphyrin dimer exhibits at 780 nm an σ2 value that is about 400 times larger than the corresponding porphyrin monomer.,Result
"At 780-nm, the resonance enhancement factor for the dimer is ca. 13 times larger than that for the monomer.",Result
"However, our experiment gives 400/13 ≈ 30 times enhancement, which serves as an evidence of strong electronic coupling between the two units.",Result
The cumulenic structure of the linker in the first excited state was favoured over the alternated in ref. 9 to explain the linear optical properties of the dimer.,Result
The strong conjugation between porphyrin units in the dimer brings first one-photon transition close to one-half of one of the strong two-photon transitions giving rise to nearly double-resonance TPA conditions.,Result
"For the porphyrin dimer studied here this ratio is equal to 2.8 GM amu–1, while for the dendrimer from it is only about 1 GM amu–1, making it a less efficient two-photon absorber in this sense than the porphyrin dimer.",Result
"In conclusion, we have observed a 400 times enhancement of TPA in conjugated porphyrin dimer, as compared to its related monomer at 780 nm.",Result
"The very strong enhancement of the TPA cross section in dimer is explained by the π-conjugation-induced red shift, strengthening of the one-photon allowed Q-transition, and strengthening of transitions from the first excited state, which all result in almost double-resonance conditions for two-photon absorption.",Result
"The results show that the addition of serum to the growth medium increases the hydrophobicity and isoelectric point (i.e.p.) of the microorganisms, and this could indicate an increase in the protein content on the cell surface.",Result
"At short separation distances between the cells and the substratum, the interaction free energy predicts a favourable adhesion for serum-grown cells while non-favourable adhesion is expected for control (TSB-grown cells) and urine-grown cells.",Result
The second type of localization comes from the dynamical disorder caused by exciton interactions with environment fluctuations.,Result
This nonexponential relaxation kinetics is observed at room temperature and is more pronounced by lowering the temperature.,Result
"As shown in Fig. 1, products arising from three-membered or four-membered ring intermediates are isotopically distinguishable.",Result
The intensity distributions of the transitions are relatively smooth without unexplained missing bands.,Result
The model used does not predict too many bands.,Result
"Besides the standard diffusion resistance, transport in non-equilibrium conditions introduces a current generator in the transmission line equivalent circuit, which is due to an inhomogeneous conductivity.",Result
Numerical simulation of impedance spectra shows that the effect of the current generator is rather large when the diffusion length is shorter than the film thickness.,Result
"In EGFP the anionic form of the chromophore dominates, which has a strong transition at 490 nm, nicely matching the output of the NOPA.",Result
The high absorbance and absence of a measurable signal from the solvent suggest that the TG signal arises from sample dichroism.,Result
The oscillatory part of the response is assigned to coherent vibrational motion in EGFP.,Result
The ‘constant’ is ascribed to the nanosecond excited state lifetime.,Result
The remaining ultrafast and picosecond relaxation times are assigned to intramolecular vibrational redistribution and vibrational cooling in the excited state respectively.,Result
"The amplitude of the oscillation is not regular, but the data are well reproduced when a second component of approximately 35 cm−1 is included (the lower frequency is not accurately determined, as data are available for at most two cycles).",Result
The same frequencies were extracted from measurements at 497 nm.,Result
The frequencies reported in Fig. 2 are lower than any previously observed for GFP.,Result
"They are also lower than any frequency calculated for the ground state, though Tozzini et al. found deformation modes around 200 cm−1 in their density functional theory and Car–Parrinello MD simulations.",Result
"It is difficult to definitively assign the frequencies observed in Fig. 2 to either the ground or excited state, since both may be excited in vibrational coherence spectroscopy.",Result
"However, the higher frequency oscillation is slow (370 fs) compared to the 60 fs pulsewidth.",Result
"A mode at 95 cm−1 is detected, which is lower in frequency than any previously reported mode in GFP.",Result
"Computed ignition delay times of hydrocarbon–oxygen mixtures (CH4-, C2H6-, C3H8-, n-C4H10-, CH4 + C2H6-, C2H4, C3H6-O2) match the experimental values.",Result

The weak side peaks corresponding to 194Pt195Pt6+ and 195Pt6196Pt+ clusters exhibit intensities that are consistent with the specified enrichment grade of the sample.,Result
"The reactions occurring are quite simple, and similar to those observed previously for smaller clusters: Oxide clusters, 195PtnO+ are formed with loss of N2.",Result
This is due to reactions occurring during the cluster accumulation period.,Result
"The reaction proceeds faster for n = 20 than for n = 8, but only one reaction step is observed.",Result
"Overall, the chemistry pattern found for all of the clusters, both anions and cations, within the range studied is quite simple.",Result
"In a few cases, also a third step resulting in 195PtnO3+ is detected, so that the reactions can be described by the simple equation pattern:Fig. 4 shows a graphical comparison of the observed rates, on a logarithmic scale, of the first reaction step, eqn. (1) for cations and anions as a function of cluster size.",Result
"One finds that the rates of the reaction, as well as the number of oxidation steps observed in the time frame of the experiment vary appreciably, and in a seemingly random manner from cluster to cluster, and the reactivity pattern is also strongly dependent on the cluster charge.",Result
"Among the cations, the n = 6 and 20 clusters exhibit the fastest reaction according to eqn. (1), with rates above the ADO collision efficiency.",Result

"Strong EPR signals from solutions of Cr(vi) and glutathione (GSH) in the presence of excess naH6 (Fig. 1; black) are attributed to a distribution of five-coordinate oxoCr(v)–naH6 complexes (d1) in which two naH6 units chelate the oxoCr(v) ion ([naH6] > [oxoCr(v)]) via combinations of the O1,O2, O7,O8 or O8,O9 groups.",Result
"First, the presence of excess Ca(ii) appears to mitigate against the formation of oxoCr(v)–naH6 species involving coordination via the O7,O8-diolato group, since (unlike the binary system) the simplest simulation model for the Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 system did not require the inclusion of a triplet, a quintet or a sextet to model the ternary analogues of [CrO(O1,O2-naH4)(O7,O8-naH3)]2− (n = 2), [CrO(O7,O8-naH3)2]3− (n = 4) or [CrO(O7,O8-naH3)(O8,O9-naH3)]3− (n = 5), respectively.",Result

"This is distinct from the binary oxoCr(v)–naH6 system, where the conformational flexibility of the glycerol tail of naH6 confers magnetic equivalence upon these protons (1H aiso ∼ 0.75 G).",Result
"The absence of O7,O8-coordinated oxoCr(v)–naH6 species in the ternary Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 system suggests that the O7 group of naH6 has a stronger affinity toward Ca(ii) than toward the oxoCr(v) ion.",Result
"Conversely, based upon the presence of O8,O9-coordinated Ca(ii)–oxoCr(v)–naH6 species, the O8 group of naH6 has an affinity toward the oxoCr(v) ion (and may be simultaneously binding Ca(ii)).",Result

"The analysis of the images and the resulting translational energy distributions from the 1 1A2 state demonstrates the existence of two decay pathways, fast mode-specific cleavage of the NH bond in the excited state (channel A) and internal conversion (IC) to the electronic ground state (S0) followed by unimolecular decomposition of the vibrationally hot S0 molecules (channel B).",Result
The results at λ = 217 nm indicate that the 1 1B2 state undergoes an ultrafast radiationless transition to 1 1A2 followed by the abovementioned direct mode-specific NH bond fission on the 1 1A2 potential energy surface (channel A′) or conversion to S0 and subsequent unimolecular decomposition (channel B′).,Result
